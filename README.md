# YOLOv5 Model for Tomato Plant Disease Detection - AI Nabta Project
This project features the YOLOv5 model, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, adapted to predict the health status of tomato plants based on leaf images. 

The model classifies the plants as either healthy or unhealthy, identifying potential diseases by analyzing visual cues from the leaves.

YOLOv5, with its powerful real-time detection capabilities, has been fine-tuned on a custom dataset of tomato plant images. This allows it to detect subtle signs of disease that may not be easily visible to the human eye, providing early warnings to farmers and agricultural researchers. By utilizing advanced deep learning techniques, the model combines speed and accuracy, making it an invaluable tool for precision agriculture.

This YOLOv5-based model is part of a broader initiative called AI Nabta, which integrates two models developed for plant disease detection. AI Nabta is focused on leveraging AI technologies to aid in crop health monitoring, offering solutions that are both scalable and efficient. The project demonstrates how artificial intelligence can revolutionize agricultural practices, improving yield predictions, and reducing the dependency on traditional manual inspection methods.

With its robust performance, YOLOv5 in this project not only identifies whether a tomato plant is healthy or unhealthy, but it also sets the stage for future advancements in crop disease management, promising more sustainable and efficient farming practices.
